![BW_Messaging](../../../.readme_images/BW_Messaging.png)

</div>

A small sample that uploads two pictures to Bandwidth's messaging media API and attaches them to send an MMS.

## Pre-Reqs

You will need the following setup:
* [Messaging Credentials](https://dev.bandwidth.com/guides/accountCredentials.html#messaging)
* [Account Configured for v2 Messaging](https://support.bandwidth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033658613-Messaging-V2-API-Account-Setup-UI-)
* ⚠️ This script is not setup to receive callbacks (IE does not expose a callback URL). A free service like [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com/) can be used as your application's callback URL for quick testing.
* A phone number allocated to your location
* A test phone number to receive the picture messages
